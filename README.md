### Summary
I am visualizing data portraying the pace of urbanization in Africa - as considered a relevant factor in analysing and addressing inequality issues.

### Description

This project seeks to look at the relationship between demographic developments and inequality trends, with a focus on urbanization. As world population continues to grow, an increasing number of people are moving to cities aspiring better living conditions, higher quality education and greater economic opportunities. 

In 2008, for the first time in human history, half of the worldâ€™s population lived in towns and cities. Africa is currently the least urbanized continent, but its annual urbanization rate is the fastest in the world. See the [UN World Urbanization Prospects 2014](https://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/publications/files/wup2014-highlights.pdf).

In 1980, only 28 percent of Africans lived in urban areas. Today, the number of Africans living in cities is 40 percent, and is projected to grow to 50 percent by 2030. As this has immediate social-economic impacts, it is interesting to investigate the relation between urbanization data and inequality trends. This visualization tries to show the rapid growth of urban population in Africa.
